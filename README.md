# London Stepper

London Stepper - a bunch of Sprinkle packages that configured for my purposes. I'm using Debian Squeeze, Ruby 1.9.2, Mysql, Nginx & Unicorn workers, Sphinx Search, Memcached, Imagemagick and stuff.

### TODO

 * Add logrotate into necessary packages
 * Compile nginx with gzip static by default
 * Create root user for mysql
 * Add gitolite package
 * Add gitlabhq package
 * Add mc package
 * Asks for passwords, usernames and hosts while install. Cache this info on local machine.
 * Check general system resources and filesystem with monit
 * Check each rails project for availability with monit
 * Test it on VM Debian Squeeze
 * Add thor bin file called 'stepper' with some pretty commands to manage remote server & projects.
